## About
I've made this app for myself, so that I can track the weight, and other things for my dog (she is called Yoko).
You can use this to log whatever you want.

Features:
- Track things, log progress
- Item types can be customized
- Export all your data! CSV export

No ads, no tracking (except what Google Play Store already does).
The code is in the public domain!
